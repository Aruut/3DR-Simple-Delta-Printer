3DR "Simple" Delta Printer
==========================

This is a derivative of RichRap's 3DR Delta printer, but redesigned from scratch to be printable from a Printrbot Simple (hence the name), and to use the Simple's parts in order to build this printer. You can find his original files here: https://github.com/RichRap/3DR-Delta-Printer

This particular fork adds some functionality I wanted to JohnSL's already brilliant models. Please be aware and abide by the license all these files are covered by - Attribution - ShareAlike Creative Commons V3 (CC BY-SA 3.0) - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

Do not forget to attribute John's work (and my small contributions) and acknowledge the work by others that this is built on.

Changes in this Fork
--------------------

- [ ] Add a slot/bracket to one of the bottom sections for a base-mounted power socket. Add holes and spacing to top and bottom frames for the extra wires running to the top that this requires.

- [ ] Add holes/brackets for a base-mounted screen/controller. Add holes and spacing to top and bottom frames for the extra cables running to the bottom that this requires.

- [ ] Re-jig the electronics mounting to fit the RUMBA board and perhaps some extra fans/boards.
