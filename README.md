3DR "Simple" Delta Printer
==========================

This is a derivative of RichRap's 3DR Delta printer, redesigned from scratch by JohnSL. You can find Rich's original files here: https://github.com/RichRap/3DR-Delta-Printer

This particular fork adds some functionality I wanted to JohnSL's (already brilliant) models. I am moving the power socket and controller panel to the base of the printer, adding a power switch, adding a mounting option for the RUMBA board, and eventually adding tool-changing mounts to the frame.

Changes in this Fork
--------------------

-[x] Add a slot/bracket to one of the bottom sections for a base-mounted power socket (4-pin Power DIN).

-[x] Add a hole for mounting a power switch to the base.

-[x] Add holes/brackets for a base-mounted screen/controller.

-[x] Add holes, spacing, and restraint holes for the extra wiring routed through the base.

-[x] Re-jig the electronics mounting to fit the RUMBA board and perhaps some extra fans/boards.

-[ ] Add hole for a USB socket on the base frame (RUMBA usb plug is rather fragile).

-[ ] Eventually add mounts for tool-swapping.
