3DR "Simple" Delta Printer
========================

This is a derivative of RichRap's 3DR Delta printer, but redesigned from scratch to be printable from a Printrbot Simple (hence the name), and to use the Simple's parts in order to build this printer. You can find his original files here: https://github.com/RichRap/3DR-Delta-Printer
