3DR "Simple" Delta Printer
==========================

This is a derivative of RichRap's 3DR Delta printer, redesigned from scratch by JohnSL. You can find Rich's original files here: https://github.com/RichRap/3DR-Delta-Printer

This particular fork adds some functionality I wanted to JohnSL's (already brilliant) models. I am moving the power socket and controller panel to the base of the printer, adding a power switch, adding a mounting option for the RUMBA board, and eventually adding tool-changing mounts to the frame.
